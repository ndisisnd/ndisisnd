            <p>
              Hi there. Iâ€™m Andy, a self-taught Product Designer. I love
              designing things that make sense, building stuff on the regular,
              and creating content for everyone about design!
            </p>
            <p>
              I work as as product designer at foodpanda. I started my product
              design journey as early as 2018, and my total experience spans
              about 2 years thus far.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in demystifying the product design field and aspire to
              build products that can impact millions of people globally.
            </p>
